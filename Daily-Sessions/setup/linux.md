## Setup Linux Environment

Since we are on linux, we already have a script file which you can run to install all the necessary packages.

The script file included is a mini version of https://github.com/rsnk96/Ubuntu-Setup-Scripts , if you want all the things follow the repo's readme.

To have a minimal setup with all the necessary stuff

 1) chmod +x setup_linux.sh
 2) ./setup_linux.sh

The setup_linux.sh will will setup your terminal, anaconda, a code editor, bash aliases and a few more packages. Do a restart after the script before continuing.
